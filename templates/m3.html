                    <h2 style="color: #e63946;">The Functioning of the Reproductive System</h2>
                    <p>The reproductive system is vital for the creation of life. It consists of various organs, each playing a crucial role in processes like ovulation, fertilization, and childbirth. Key organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina in females, and the testes, vas deferens, and penis in males.</p>

                    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> The ovaries contain all the eggs a person will ever have from birth, and these are released one at a time during ovulation.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">Key Functions:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm).</li>
                        <li>Secretion of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.</li>
                        <li>Facilitating fertilization and supporting pregnancy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color: #e63946;">Maintaining Reproductive Health</h2>
                    <p>Reproductive health goes beyond the absence of diseaseâ€”it involves a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system. Here are some essential steps:</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">1. Regular Checkups</h3>
                    <p>Routine visits to a gynecologist or urologist are crucial for early detection of potential issues, such as infections, hormonal imbalances, or abnormalities.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">2. Safe Practices</h3>
                    <p>Using protection during intercourse helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">3. Balanced Nutrition</h3>
                    <p>A diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants supports hormonal balance and overall reproductive health. Foods like leafy greens, nuts, and fish are particularly beneficial.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">4. Staying Active</h3>
                    <p>Regular exercise improves blood circulation, reduces stress, and maintains a healthy weight, all of which are important for reproductive health.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #6a0572;">5. Screenings and Vaccinations</h3>
                    <p>Screening for conditions like cervical cancer and getting vaccinated against HPV can significantly reduce risks associated with reproductive health issues.</p>
